https://rothamstedfarm.farmos.net/log/292,2020-02-12 00:00:00,WW/ OSR Soil Cores (Soil Mineral N),,RRES LSRE Site,,Experiment,,,,,,,"Method: 90cm soil cores taken from OSR and WW plots. Four cores are taken per subplot from the yield strip closest to the centre line (7.5m). Where compost has been applied in any previous year, sub-plot samples are kept separate. Where compost has not been applied, samples from sub-plots are pooled to reduce costs. None of the ploughed winter wheat plots were sampled this year as they have not been drilled. Plots H02, H45 and H50 are also not sampled as these are failed plots. Samples are taken by driving over the plots using the golf buggy, introducing wheelings but very light ones. The sample points are not geo-referenced. Samples are send to NRM for mineral N, which is used to calculate total available N. The results are usually available within a week.",

https://rothamstedfarm.farmos.net/log/1688,2020-07-06 11:00:32,Weekly check,PASTURES,2020/R/CM/2053,,,,,,,,,Weekly check of plots. All plots flowering still. Some red colouration of leaves observed. Johnathan Napier was present and said he would check with other growers of camelina for a likely cause. Decision made to destroy pollen barrier as it was not dense enough and getting weedy. Johnathans team to weed plots in coming days.,
