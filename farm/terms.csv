top dressing,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000042,A broadcast application in which a material entity is applied to an area after seedling emergence and establishment of plants.
fertilizer basal application,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000041,A broadcast application in which fertilizer is applied to an area before planting or before seedling emergence.
fertigation,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000047,An application method in which a water-soluble fertilizer is injected into water flowing through an irrigation system.

chemigation,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000044,An application method in which a water-soluble chemical is injected into water flowing through an irrigation system.
band application,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000038,"An application method in which a material entity is applied in bands below, above, on one side, or on both sides of seeds or seedlings at planting."
side dressing,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000039,A band application in which the material entity is applied after seeding or planting.
aerial application,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000037,An application method in which a liquid material entity is applied by aircraft to an area.
drilling,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000413,An application method in which seeds are uniformlyplaced into shallow furrows before closing the furrows.
dibbling,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AGRO_00000412,An application method in which a material entity is placed into the soil in holes made with a pointed implement.
